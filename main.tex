\section{Introduction}


\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{}


\subsection{Background}

 
 
 
There are multiple paths through which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the economic security of working age adults with disabilities. Disruptions to the economy and risk of disease spread led some who were working prior to the pandemic to exit the labor market \citep{cheng2020back, goda2021impact moen2020disparate, quinby2021older }, thereby reducing income through wage earnings. This reduction in labor force participation has not been offset by a subsequent increase in Social Security  claiming [CITE?].   


Reduced consumption \citep{baker2020does,horvath2021covid} 

households often unable to pay their bills \citep{clark2021financial,schneider2020household}. 

  
We begin our analysis by  

We further explore mechanisms underlying changes 

 

Taken together, the results of this study provide important detail about the depth and breadth of the inequity of financial hardship experienced in the pandemic. Our findings indicate heterogeneous effects for vulnerable segments of the population.

\section{ Prior Literature}

 

\subsection{COVID-19 and  Financial Security  }

There is a burgeoning body of literature on the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for U.S. households. Most directly, several studies analyze changes in labor force participation and unemployment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g.  \cite{cheng2020back}), with a few studies focusing on labor trends  \citep{goda2021impact,moen2020disparate,quinby2021older}.   

Reductions in income may be offset in part by reductions in consumption  \citep{baker2020does,casado2020aggregate,chetty2020did,farrell2020consumption,horvath2021covid}. For example, \cite{farrell2020consumption} find an overall 10 percent decline in consumer spending following the onset of the pandemic. However, the effects on consumption are heterogeneous across a number of dimensions.  \cite{chetty2020did} find that much of the reduction in spending is concentrated among higher income households—households in the top income quartile spent 13 percent less as of mid-July 2020 relative to January 2020, whereas households in the bottom income quartile reduced consumption by only 4 percent during the same period. For those experiencing a COVID related loss of income, \cite{farrell2020consumption} find that receipt of pandemic-related unemployment benefits is associated with a 10 percent increase in consumer spending relative to the prior year. 


 
 
 Emerson and colleagues studied the effects of pandemic  on people with disabilities in the UK ‘Understanding Society’, an annual household panel study \citep{emerson2021impact}. Respondents with disability were more likely to experience higher levels of financial stress.  

 Gignac and colleagues studied people with physical or mental health disabilities in Canada. People with a  disability reported more  financial concerns, more contract work, and unmet accommodations at work  than those with no disability. \citep{gignac2021impacts}

  Goda, et al sue Current Population Survey and monthly Google Trends data to show fewer labor force exits due to disability and applications for disability insurance \citep{goda2022impact}


\citeauthor{schur2021covid} find White and Black women with disabilities experienced relatively greater employment losses during the pandemic compared to White men without disabilities. \citep{schur2021covid}

   \cite{cowan2020short} also finds workers with a disability—have experienced the largest declines in the likelihood of (full-time) work and work hours.

Previous economic downturns have led to increases in applications for and, eventually, receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits. In the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 and its aftermath, however, SSDI applications did not increase. One important factor may have been the prolonged closure of SSA field offices, since previous research finds that field office closures lead to persistent declines in SSDI beneficiaries in the surrounding communities. In this case, there may be pent-up demand for SSDI benefits as normal operations resume in areas where the economy has not fully recovered. Government support programs were materially different than in past recessions, which appears to have enabled people to weather the downturn and avoid applying for SSDI benefits. \cite{mullen2022economic}

 


 
 
\section{Data and Methods}
We explore the differences in financial wellbeing of households with and without disabilities in two different time periods. First, we use two datasets that are repeated cross sections, allowing us to compare households with and without disabilities before and after the start of the pandemic. Second, we use individual-level data that is recorded monthly starting in the spring of 2020. This tells us more about the evolution of the gap between households with and without disabilities throughout the pandemic. 

\textcolor{blue}{DO WE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE THREE DIFFERENT MEASURES OF DISABILITY?}


We explain each data and empirical strategy next. 

\subsection{Before and After Pandemic Changes}
We use two datasets to explore the differences in financial security for those with and without disabilities before and after the pandemic. 

First, we use the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) data, a nationally-representative survey conducted every three years by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation. We use data from the 2018 and 2021 waves, as they include information on disability status, as well as financial wellbeing. The 2021 survey was conducted in the late summer to early fall. We consider a respondent to have a disability if they answered ``Permanently sick, disabled, or unable to work" to the question ``Which of the following best describes your current employment or work status?" We recognize that this is a relatively broad definition of disability. In order to examine a sample that is working-age, we limit our respondents to those between 18 and 64 years of age. 

We define five main variables of interest in this sample that all reflect the financial security of the household: presence of emergency savings, financial anxiety, whether they made a late credit card payment, whether they used alternative financial services, and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's financial wellbeing scale (FWB). The first four are dummy variables. FWB is measured from 0 to 100, based on the answers to five questions related to one's ability to keep up with day-to-day or month-to-month finances, as well as individual expectations of their ability to meet future financial goals.\footnote{For more on the FWB measure, see \url{https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/financial-well-being/about/}.}  Summary statistics for the NFCS data are in Appendix Table \ref{NFCS_Summstats}. 


To investigate how the FWB score changed before and after the pandemic for the respondents with disabilities as compared to the same for the respondents without disabilities, we estimate the following model:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn1}
Y_{it}=\alpha+\beta_0 Disability_i + \beta_1 Post_t+ \beta_2 Disability_i \times Post_t +\gamma X_i + \epsilon_{it} 
\end{equation}

where $Y_{it}$ refers to the outcome variable for respondent $i$ in year $t$, $Disability_i$ is an indicator which takes a value of 1 for the respondents with disabilities and a 0 otherwise, and $Post_t$ is an indicator which takes a value of 1 for the post-pandemic year (2021) and a 0 otherwise. The coefficient of interest is $\beta_2$ which shows the difference in post-pre change in financial well-being outcomes between respondents with and without disabilities after the pandemic started. Equation \ref{eqn1} includes individual-level control variables, including dummies for race/ethnicity, gender, and income buckets. 

Second, we use data from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) 2018-2021 provided by the Federal Reserve Board. We identify respondents with disabilities if they answered \emph{yes} to the question ``Did health/medical limitations or disability contribute to you not working / not working as much as you wanted last month?'' Again, we limit our sample to respondents aged between 18 and 64. We consider four SHED questions related to financial hardship. Table \ref{table:SHED.ques.table} provides a description of the these questions with the response options. Combining respondents who answered all the key questions in SHED 2018-2021, we get a sample of 10,983 respondents. Appendix Table \ref{SHED_Sumstats} provides summary statistics for the SHED analytical sample. We continue to estimate a version of Equation \ref{eqn1}, in which $Post$ refers to observations from SHED 2020 (conducted in November 2020) and 2021 (conducted between October and November 2021).

\subsection{Within Pandemic Changes}

This paper uses data from the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) to investigate whether financial hardship worsened among people with disabilities compared to people without disabilities over the pandemic. The U.S. Census Bureau collaborated with multiple other federal agencies to conduct the HPS. The key objective of the survey was to quickly and efficiently gather data on the hardships faced by American households during the pandemic. Although the HPS provides a rich source of data collected over regular intervals from April 2020 to the time of writing this paper, it does not have a variable that directly identifies people with disabilities. We use the Medicare eligibility rule for non-elderly adults to identify the respondents with disabilities. Specifically, we identify a respondent as a person with disability if they meet two conditions: 1) aged between 19 and 64 and 2) enrolled in Medicare. Although this approach helps us correctly identify a segment of the respondents with disabilities, it cannot detect all the respondents with disabilities. 

In terms of outcomes of interest, we use three variables related to financial hardship: 1) food insufficiency in the last seven days, 2) difficulty with financial expenses in the last 7 days, and 3) confidence in paying the next month's rent/mortgage payments. The question on food insufficiency asks:  `` In the last 7 days, which of these statements best describes the food eaten in your household? Select only one answer.'' The response options are 1) enough of the kinds of food (I/we) wanted to eat, 2) enough, but not always the kinds of food (I/we) wanted to eat, 3) sometimes not enough to eat, and 4) often not enough to eat. We create a \emph{food insufficiency} indicator variable, which takes a value of 1 if the respondent selected either sometimes not enough to eat or often not enough to eat and a otherwise. The question on difficulty with financial expenses asks: ``In the last 7 days, how difficult has it been for your household to pay for usual household expenses, including but not limited to food, rent or mortgage, car payments, medical expenses, student loans, and so on? Select only one answer.'' The response options are: 1) not at all difficult, 2) a little difficult, 3) somewhat difficult, and 4) very difficult. We create a \emph{difficulty with expenses} indicator variable, which takes a value of 1 if a respondent selected either somewhat difficult or very difficult and 0 otherwise. Finally, the question on confidence in paying next mortgage/rent payment asks: ``How confident are you that your household will be able to pay your next rent or mortgage payment on time? Select only one answer.'' The response options are 1) not at all confident, 2) slightly confident, 3) moderately confident, and 4) highly confident. We create a \emph{not confident in paying mortgage/rent} indicator variable, which takes a value of 1 if the respondent selected either not at all confident or slightly confident and 0 otherwise.

\subsubsection{Analytical Samples}
As the sample sizes at the individual HPS week level get smaller, we combine respondents from multiple HPS weeks to create quarterly (trimonthly) samples. Table \ref{table:period.table} provides a description of the coding of these quarterly periods. We create three analytical samples based on the responses to the three questions of interest. Appendix tables \ref{hps_food_sample}-\ref{hps_mortgage_sample} provide the summary statistics for the HPS data.   

\begin{table}[ht]

2                          & 10-15                & July-September, 2020           \\
3                          & 16-21                & October-December, 2020         \\
4                          & 22-27                & January-March, 2021            \\
5                          & 28-33                & April-June, 2021               \\
6                          & 34-38                & July-September, 2021           \\
7                          & 39-40                & October-December, 2021\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the food insufficiency sample, we combine respondents from HPS weeks 1 to 40, which has a total sample of 3,192,531 respondents. Next, we narrow it down to respondents aged between 19 and 64 who responded either yes or no to the Medicare coverage question, which results in a sample  of 1,732,037 respondents. Finally, we eliminate those who did not answer the food insufficiency question and get a sample of 1,729,108 respondents. \\
\\
As the HPS started asking the difficulty with expenses question from week 13 onward, for the difficulty with expenses sample, we combine respondents from HPS weeks 13 to 40, which have a total sample of 2,104,217 respondents. After narrowing it down to respondents aged between 19 and 64 who responded either yes or no to the Medicare coverage question, we get a sample of 1,106,186 respondents. Among these respondents, a total of 1,104,824 answered the difficulty with expenses question. \\
\\
For the confidence in paying next rent/mortgage payments sample, we combine respondents from HPS weeks 1 to 40 for whom the tenure status was either \emph{owned with a mortgage or loan (including home equity loans)} or \emph{rented} (sample size=1,962,199). Narrowing it down to respondents aged between 19 and 64 who responded either yes or no to the Medicare coverage question results in a sample of 1,400,608 respondents. The analytical sample for analyzing the confidence in paying rent/mortgage outcome consists of 1,395,349 respondents who answered the confidence in paying rent/mortgage question.

\subsubsection{Estimation}
To investigate whether the financial hardships faced by people with disabilities worsened over time compared to people without disabilities, we estimate the following model: \\
\begin{equation}\label{eqn2}
Y_{it}= \alpha_0+\alpha_1 Disability_i+\sum_{t=2}^{7} \beta_t Period_t+\sum_{t=2}^{7} \gamma_t Disability_i \times Period_t
+e_{it} 
\end{equation}

where $Y_{it}$ refers to the value of the outcome variable for respondent $i$ in period $t$, $disability_i$ is a dummy variable which takes a value of 1 if respondent $i$ is both aged 19-64 and enrolled in Medicare, and a 0 otherwise, $period_t$ refers to a vector of dummy variables which take a value of 1 for the quarterly period $t$ and a 0 otherwise. We are primarily interested in the coefficients of the interaction terms ($Disability_i \times Period_t$), comparing the difference across people with and without disabilities in each given period compared to period one.  \\


This approach helps us explore the extent to which the gap in the three outcome variables between the two groups evolved over time in the first two years of the pandemic. We estimate equation \ref{eqn2} with and without  control variables. The control variables are state of residence, gender, pre-tax annual household income in buckets, race, Hispanic status, age, homeownership status, marital status, educational attainment, number of dependents below 18, and household size.



\section{Findings}
\subsection{Before and After Pandemic Changes}
We use two different surveys that capture different measures of economic and financial security, different measures of disability, and different points in time post-pandemic. In the NFCS, disability represents those who were ``permanently sick, disabled, or unable to work." In the SHED, disability represents those who had health or medical limitations that prevented them from working that month. Thus, the NFCS captures a population with  more long-term problems, and the SHED has a more inclusive measure that contains those with short-term medical limitations. The SHED 2020 and 2021 surveys took place in the fall of each year, and the NFCS surveys took place late summer of 2021. 

\subsubsection{NFCS Findings}

Beginning with the NFCS, Figure \ref{NFCS_Y} shows the difference in financial outcomes across 2018 and 2021 for respondents with and without disabilities. The changes are measured in percentage point differences, since each outcome is a dummy variable. While both groups were more likely to have emergency savings in 2021 than 2018, those without disabilities experienced a greater increase.\footnote{The full question is: Have you set aside emergency or rainy day funds that would cover your expenses for 3 months, in case of sickness, job loss, economic downturn, or other emergencies?} At the same time, financial anxiety increased by more for people without disabilities than people with disabilities. A similar story exists for AFS use, which includes payday loans, pawn shops, tax return advances, and rent-to-own services. However, the AFS measure asks about the last five years, making it potentially less of a pandemic story and a more overall trend. Both groups saw an equal increase in the likelihood of having a credit card with a late payment, conditional on having a credit card. Taken together, these findings suggest that though households are more likely to have three months of savings in case of emergencies, they are more  anxious about the future of their financial situation than they were three years prior. While households with disabilities were more likely to be financially anxious than before the pandemic started, the change in their experiences are less severe than people without disabilities. This could be because SSA's programs provide a guarantee of future income for households with disabilities. 

We next look at subjective measures in Figure \ref{NFCS_FWB} in the CFPB's FWB score. Overall, people with disabilities saw an improvement in FWB, while people without disabilities saw a small decrease in FWB. The only measure within the scale that respondents with disabilities did worse on in 2021 than 2018 was thinking the money they had or will save won't last. This matches the financial anxiety increase, suggesting that there is concern for the future. However, people with disabilities were less likely to say they were just getting by financially, they will never have the things they want in life because of money, and their finances controlled their lives. They were more likely to say they had money left over at the end of the month, consistent with the finding from Figure \ref{NFCS_Y} that respondents with disabilities had more emergency savings in 2021 than 2018. 

Overall, these findings suggest that while the ability to keep up with month-to-month and day-to-day finances improved for respondents with disabilities from 2018 to 2021---particularly when compared to those without disabilities---they remain more anxious about their financial future than in the past. The 2021 survey took place over a year into the pandemic, but worldwide changes due to the pandemic could have made people more uncertain about the future. On every marker except for emergency savings, respondents with disabilities had less detrimental changes from 2018 to 2021. 

\subsubsection{SHED Findings}
%%Fix the figure (SHED barplots) label%% 
Figure \ref{shed.desc.graph} shows the post- and pre-pandemic changes in financial hardships for respondents with and without disabilities. All the outcomes are coded as binary variables for which 1 refers to a higher level of financial hardship. We observe that the respondents with disabilities are less likely to spend more than income in the post-pandemic period, whereas there is no change in the same outcome for the respondents with no disabilities. Although both groups are less likely to mention greater hardship while responding to the question on how they are managing their finances (\emph{difficult to get by}), the decrease is higher for the respondents with disabilities. Surprisingly, both groups mention higher hardship while answering the question on whether they are better off/the same/worse off financially compared to 12 months ago (\emph{no better off}); however, the increased likelihood of greater hardship is lower for respondents with disabilities. Finally, we observe no changes in the incidence of carrying an unpaid balance on one or more of credit cards (conditional on having at least one credit card) in the past 12 months for the respondents with disabilities. Interestingly, we observe a drop in the same outcome for the respondents with no disabilities. Overall, these findings imply that there were less detrimental pre- and post-pandemic changes in financial hardships for people with disabilities except for the no change in the incidence of carrying some credit card balance. 

Table \ref{table:shed.reg.table} shows the results obtained by estimating equation (\ref{eqn1}) on the four outcome variables from the SHED. We observe statistically significant decreases in \emph{difficult to get by} and \emph{no better off} outcomes and a significant increase in \emph{credit card balance} outcome for the respondents with disabilities; however, we do not observe any significant change in the (\emph{Spend$>$Income}) outcome for the respondents with disabilities. In general, the regression findings align with the descriptive findings. 

\subsection{Within Pandemic Changes}

Figures \ref{food_insuf_desc}-\ref{mort_conf_desc} show the trends in the three outcome variables for the respondents with and without disabilities. Descriptively, it appears that for the food insufficiency and difficulty with expenses variables, the gap in the average value between the two groups remained almost the same. For the confidence in paying next rent/mortgage payment variable, the gap in the average value between the two variables remained the same except in the last two quarterly periods, in which respondents with disabilities apparently reported lower confidence. Figures \ref{food_insuf_wc}-\ref{rent_conf_wc} show the extent to which the gap in the three outcome variables between people with and without disabilities changed over the quarterly periods relative to period 1 (April-June 2020). In figure \ref{food_insuf_wc}, we observe that the estimated coefficient is not significantly different from 0 at the 5 percent significance level in any of the periods except in period 6 (July-September 2021), which suggests that the gap in food insufficiency for the two groups remained mostly the same throughout the pandemic. Figure \ref{expens_dif_wc} shows similar trends for the difficulty with expenses variable. Lastly,  figure \ref{rent_conf_wc} shows that for the rent/mortgage confidence variable, there was no significant change in the gap in the outcome between the two groups until period 5 relative to period 1; however, we do observe increasing gap in the outcome between the two groups in the last two periods (between July and December 2021) relative to period 1. Overall, these findings indicate that the financial hardship faced by the people with disabilities was not disproportionately higher for the most parts over the studied period. 

\section{Conclusion}
 
Implications for Social Security Programs
 
Increased eligibility for SSI and Medicaid, as well as SNAP and LIHEAP

PWD are more anxious  - but maybe not living as long - foregone health care - future outcomes could be negative - changing trajectories

Look for papers on health, DI, SSI - what are trends in anxiety and other measures of distress

SSA benefits are more secure and should  be more stable for most people  - anxiety could be related to other HH members

HHs with someone who has disability are not able to take advantage of strong labor markets relative to non disabled

Look at tables of BRFSS

\cite{blanchflower2022covid}

SSA will find higher levels of distress among SSDI and SSI recipients 

Implications - National Disability Institute programs for financial capability
